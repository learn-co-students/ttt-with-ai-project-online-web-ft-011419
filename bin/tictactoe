# Ask the user for who should go first and be "X".
# Use the input to correctly initialize a Game with the appropriate player types and token values.
# When the game is over, the CLI should prompt the user if they would like to play again and allow them to choose a new configuration for the game as described above. If the user doesn't want to play again, exit the program.
# You can implement this logic within the bin/tictactoe directly or encapsulate it within Game via a method like #start and simply evoke that method in the CLI. There is no wrong way to implement code that works.
